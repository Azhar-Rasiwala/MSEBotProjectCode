# MSEBotProjectCode

Initialized: 03/18/2021

Final Updates: 04/10/2020

This is the modified MSE bot code for the use of MSE2202 Lab Section 2, Group 5: Azhar Rasiwala, Devon Bradley, Ryan Cunningham and Jennifer Villneuve. The main branch was developed to completion (a succesful robot run) and was used by Devon as she had her bot completed first. All other group members created seperate branches for their respective modifications for navigation and climb interval. Major changes were made to the motor index switch cases in order to facilitate navigation. In general there is a case for every movement that the robot makes. A seperate header file for climbing routines was added to avoid cluttering the already densely packed main project INO file.
